Example output files for bug: Unexpected behaviour of Fortran OpenMP code

These files are example outputs which demonstrate the bug in the original code,
ONETEP (http://www.onetep.org).

The code was slightly modified to print out the value of the variable 
"ringing_warning_issued" on entry and exit to the routine which evaluates
boundary conditions for the multigrid solver. This demonstrates the change
in behaviour upon
- change of compiler
- compilation with/without OpenMP
- use of explicit SAVE attribute

All outputs were generated with a single MPI process and with 1 OpenMP thread
to eliminate any possibility of parallelism affecting the bug. 

Examples:

pyruvate_solvation_auto_1OMP_1MPI_ifort17.out
- Bug is evident (value of ringing_warning_issued is not preserved across
  subroutine calls)
- Compiled with Intel Fortran 17.0.2, with -qopenmp

pyruvate_solvation_auto_NOOMP_1MPI_ifort17.out
- Bug is not evident (value of ringing_warning_issued is preserved across
  subroutine calls)
- Compiled with Intel Fortran 17.0.2, without -qopenmp

pyruvate_solvation_auto_1OMP_1MPI_explicit_save_ifort17.out
- Bug is not evident (value of ringing_warning_issued is preserved across
  subroutine calls)
- Compiled with Intel Fortran 17.0.2, with -qopenmp
- ringing_warning_issued has an explicit SAVE attribute

pyruvate_solvation_auto_1OMP_1MPI_gfortran492.out
- Bug is not evident (value of ringing_warning_issued is preserved across
  subroutine calls)
- Compiled with GFortran 4.9.2, with -fopenmp

    \item[Status] Resolved, but unsure why! \\
                  Is this a compiler bug, or a subtle bug in the code?
    
    % - I think the difficulty in preparing a MWE is an interesting topic to 
    %   discuss.
    %   - It is unclear whether this is a compiler bug, or a consequence of 
    %     some subtle error elsewhere in the code.

  {\footnotesize
  \begin{itemize}
    \item While investigating this bug, I discovered some useful information about GFortran and Intel Fortran...
    \item Compiling with OpenMP flags causes compilers to silently apply flags which change how variables are allocated:
    \begin{description}
      \item[GFortran] \texttt{-fopenmp} implies \texttt{-frecursive}, which forces all local arrays to be allocated on the stack.
      \item[Intel Fortran] \texttt{-qopenmp} implies \texttt{-automatic}, which causes all local, non-SAVEd variables to be allocated on the run-time stack.
    \end{description}
